@BuildEmpire @DigitalSite @DatesAndPrices
Feature: Most course instances have the learning material named VLE.
As part of UAT of the Dates & Prices work business stakeholders have requested that this leanring material is NOT displayed to users of the website.

Given_ a course instance exists in Product Factory
and is published for display to the website
when the course instances includes the learning material VLE
then I expect all other learning materials to display
and the any named VLE to be hidden
