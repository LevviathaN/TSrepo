@BuildEmpire @DigitalSite @DatesAndPrices
Feature: Following UAT of Dates & Prices, a requirement change exists to hide session timings and the start time (keep the start date) for Online Classroom course instances.
  This is because for the prospective learning interested in applying for a Online Classroom the session times are of no relevance, as the course can be taken at any time.
  Session times are recorded in Product Factory for internal BPP Revenue Recognition purposes.
  It is recognised that removing the session timings for Online Classroom course instance will create additional signifcant white space on the left hand side of the accordian view.
  We have NO visuals designs for this scenario. We are expecting specification of additional static text to be placed in this white space.
  Loreum Ipsum text can be used temporarily.
  NOTE: This change ONLY applies to Online Classroom course instances, and not Online Classroom Live course instances.
