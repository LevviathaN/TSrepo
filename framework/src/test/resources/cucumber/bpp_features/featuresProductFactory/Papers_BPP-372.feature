@ProductFactory @Papers
Feature: Reference Data - Paper - BPP-372
  As a Senior Product Setter
  I need to be able to create Papers
  So that I can use the Paper as part of a course template construction and shared between templates and instances.

  Background:
    Given I execute "Log In" reusable step

  @Positive @Regression #TC-772
  Scenario: Add a New Paper Using a Modal
    Given I execute "Create Paper" reusable step

  @Negative @P2 #TC-771
  Scenario: Submitting Incomplete Paper Fields
    When I click on the "Programme" "Product Factory navigation item"
    When I click on the "Papers" "Product Factory navigation sub item"
    Then I click on the "Create" "Product Factory button"
    Then Attribute "tabindex" of "Save" "Product Factory button" should have value "-1"

  @Negative @P2 #TC-773
  Scenario: Add a Paper Where Description Already Exists
    And I remember "AutoPprSN" text as "EC_PPR_SN" variable
    And I remember "AutoPaperName" text as "EC_PAPER_NAME" variable
    And I remember "AutoPaperDescription" text as "EC_PAPER_DESCRIPTION" variable
    When I execute modified "Create Paper" reusable step
