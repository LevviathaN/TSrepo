Feature: Financial Dimension - Edit Validation - BPP-3328
  As a Senior Product Setter
  I want the "Applies To" field on a Financial Dimension to be readonly when editing
  So that I cannot introduce breaking changes to existing Financial Dimensions.

  Background:
    Given I execute "Log In" reusable step
    And I execute "Remember Variables For Creation " reusable step
    And I execute "Remember Variables Two" reusable step

    When I click on the "Financials" "Product Factory navigation item"

    And I click on the "<EC>" "Product Factory edit button"
