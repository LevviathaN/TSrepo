@ProductFactory @UserPermissions
Feature: Apply user permissions to frontend features - BPP-650
  As a User,
  I want different features of the frontend application to be hidden or disabled when I does not have specific permission to access those features,
  so that they can be associated to the audit when deactivating Courses.
