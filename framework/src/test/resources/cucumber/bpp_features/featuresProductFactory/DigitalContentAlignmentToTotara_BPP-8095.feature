Feature: Better alignment of Totara Course and Product Factory Digital Content (Terra Changes) - BPP-8095
  As a member of VLE Operations
  I would like the Course Name and Category in Totara to reflect the Digital Content that's setup in Product Factory
  So that I know what my Course represents
  Students aren't confused by a Course Name that doesn't reflect what they are studying
