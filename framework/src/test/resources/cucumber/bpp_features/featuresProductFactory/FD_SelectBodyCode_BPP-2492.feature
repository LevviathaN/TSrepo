Feature: Financial Dimension - Select Body Code - BPP-2492
  As a Senior Product Setter
  I want to be able to select a Financial Dimension on an individual Body
  so that I can track this for accounting purposes.

  Background:

    Given I execute "Log In" reusable step
    And I remember "AutoVerticalName" text as "EC_VERTICAL_NAME" variable
    And I execute "Remember Variables For Creation " reusable step
