Feature: BPP Digital CMS Validation Amends
  As an admin
  I expect to be able to give a CMS page the same NAME as a page that already exists, provided that the it has a different parent (either "CMS Page Parent" OR "Custom parent URL")
  As this will allow BPP to create their preferred URL structure

  Background:
    Given I execute "Log In to Hub as Admin" reusable step
