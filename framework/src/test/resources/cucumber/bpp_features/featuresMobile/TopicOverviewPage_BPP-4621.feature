Feature: Topic Overview Page
  The completion status key is below the Learning Material heading
  Labels, sub labels and learning activities appear across only one column
  As a Hub user, viewing the Topic Overview page, expect to see a new "completion status" indicator on labels that are not indented,
  that indicates how many sub-labels / unindented activities under this label have been completed
